Murder Mystery SQL Project and Web Scraping
Overview:
This project involves two main components: a murder mystery SQL project and web scraping from a website.

Murder Mystery SQL Project:
In the murder mystery SQL project, we delve into a fictional murder case where we utilize SQL queries to analyze a database containing various tables related to the case. The objective is to solve the mystery by querying the database, examining relationships between different entities such as suspects, victims, witnesses, and evidence. Through careful analysis and deduction, we aim to uncover clues, identify suspects, and ultimately solve the case.

Web Scraping:
In addition to the SQL project, this repository also includes web scraping scripts designed to extract data from a specific website. The web scraping process involves fetching HTML content from the target website, parsing the content to extract relevant information, and storing the data in a structured format for further analysis or usage. This component showcases the use of Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Pandas for web scraping and data manipulation.
